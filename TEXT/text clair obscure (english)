        <h2>Why i love this game ?</h2>
        <h3>Clair Obscure : Expedition 33 is a game really poetic</h3>
        <p>
            during all the game, a lot of differents scenes are really poetic or full of metaphore which make
            the history very beautiful but also it's characters really endearing. Indeed, the relations between the différents
            characters are really well built and it's one of the particularity of the game that i find incredible but also
            really beautiful and poetic.
        </p>
        <p>
            More of that, all the cutscenes are made with motion capture with real actors which make the cutscenes
            lively and human. We can almost take the place of the characters and feel his feelings.
        </p>
        <h3>The musics of the game are also beautiful and have a powerfull meaning</h3>
        <p>
            Each music of the game leave behind it a powerfull trace or meaning in our ears but also in our minds
            which give us the envy to listen it again and again, a lot of time.
            Each musics has a strong meaning either during the combats or no. Some musics are intense
            like all the others wgucg are really beautiful or funny to listen.
